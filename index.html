        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Jagdish Chandra Bose's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose was born in a Bengali Kayastha family in Munsiganj (Bikrampur), Bengal Presidency, (present-day
            Bangladesh) on 30 November 1858
          </li>
          <li>
            Bose’s father sent him to a vernacular school in Munshiganj at a young age, because he believed his son should know his own
            mother tongue before learning English
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1875, he passed the Entrance Examination (equivalent to school graduation) of the University of Calcutta. Soon, he got
            admission to St. Xavier’s College, Calcutta
          </li>
          <li>He then obtained his B.A. degree in physics from Christ College, Cambridge</li>
          <li>
            Jagadish Chandra Bose returned to India in 1885 and joined Presidency College, Kolkata as an Assistant Professor of Physics,
            where he remained till 1915
          </li>
          <li>
            During this period, Bose also started doing original scientific work in the area of microwaves, carrying out experiments
            involving refraction, diffraction and polarization
          </li>
          <li>
            The first remarkable aspect of Bose’s follow-up microwave research was that he reduced the waves to the millimetre level (about
            5 mm wavelength). He realised the disadvantages of long waves for studying their light-like properties
          </li>
          <li>
            Jagadish ChandraBose had invented the wireless telegraphy and had also held a demonstration in 1895 but he did not file for a
            patent. Italian scientist Guglielmo Marconi on the other hand had made a similar demonstration in 1897, two years after Bose’s
            demonstration but Marconi filed for a patent in 1896. So, though Bose had done pioneering work in the field, Marconi got the
            credit for the invention
          </li>
          <li>
            During a November 1894 public demonstration at Town Hall of Kolkata, Bose ignited gunpowder and rang a bell at a distance using
            millimetre range wavelength microwaves
          </li>
          <li>
            Jagadish Chandra Bose invented many of the microwave components familiar today – waveguides, horn antennas, polarizers,
            dielectric lenses and prisms, and even semiconductor detectors of electromagnetic radiation in the last decade of the nineteenth
            century
          </li>

          <li>
            He then turned his attention to response phenomena in plants. He showed that not only animal but vegetable tissues, produce
            similar electric response under different kinds of stimuli – mechanical, thermal, electrical and chemical
          </li>
          <li>
            Bose authored two illustrious books; ‘Response in the Living and Non-living’ (1902) and ‘The Nervous Mechanism of Plants’ (1926)
          </li>
          <li>British king Knighted Bose in 1917. Soon, Royal Society elected him as Fellow of the Royal Society, London</li>
          <li>
            Jagadish Chandra Bose died on 23 November 1937 (aged 78) Giridih, Bengal Presidency, British India (now Giridih, Jharkhand,
            India)
          </li>
          <li>Jagadish Chandra Bose also suggested the existence of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun, which was confirmed in 1944</li>
          <li>
            Sir Nevill Mott, who won the Nobel Prize in 1977, said Bose was about 60 years ahead of his time and had rightly predicted use
            of N-type and P-type semiconductors in the future
          </li>
          <li>In 1997, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers named Bose as a “father of radio science”</li>
          <li>On 30 November 2016, Goggle celebrated 158th birth by showcasing Google Doodle on Google homepage</li>
          <li>
            Jagadish Chandra Bose is also credited with discovering millimetre length electromagnetic waves and being a pioneer in the field
            of biophysics
          </li>
          <li>
            Bose had worked all along without the right kind of scientific instruments and laboratory. For a long time he had been thinking
            of building a laboratory. The result was the establishment of the Bose Research Institute in Kolkata. It continues to be a
            famous centre of research in basic sciences
          </li>
          <li>
            Perhaps Bose’s greatest achievement was his invention of the crescograph, which allowed scientists to discover how the seasons
            and external stimuli affected plant life
          </li>
          <li>
            Bose’s advanced equipment are preserved by The Bose Institute in Kolkata. A multi-beam receptor developed on his work was used
            in the NRAO 12 Metre Telescope located in Arizona, USA
          </li>
          <li>The Bose Crater is located close to Crater Bhabha and Crater Adler and has a reported diameter of 91 kilometres.</li>

            “They would be our worst enemy who would wish us to live only on the glories of the past and die off from the face of the earth in sheer passivity. By continuous achievement alone we can justify our great ancestry. We do not honour our ancestors by the false claim that they are omniscient and had nothing more to learn.”
